üì¢ Important Note: Video Call Functionality Limitations in Deployed Environment

‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: Video call functionality is currently limited in the deployed/live version of this application. For the best experience, I recommend cloning the repository and running the application locally.

üöÄ Why is it not working on the deployed version?
To establish a seamless peer-to-peer connection for video calling, the Node.js server and the Peer server need to run on different ports. However, hosting service providers like Render and Railway typically allow running only a single server or process on a specific port. As a result, when the application is deployed, only one person's video will be rendered during the video call.

üí° How to make it work perfectly?
To fully experience the video call functionality and enable proper communication between the doctor and patient, I encourage you to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Jishnuraj2001/doctor_patient_appointment_booking_system_pococare.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
3. Start the Node.js server: `npm run server`
4. Start the Peer server on a separate port: `peerjs --port 3001`
5. Access the application locally: Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:<your-port>`

By running the application locally, you can ensure that the Node.js server and the Peer server operate on different ports, enabling successful peer-to-peer communication during video calls.

üîç Need assistance or have questions?
If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the video call functionality, please don't hesitate to reach out.

The `authenticator` middleware function is used to authenticate requests using JWT. It verifies the presence and validity of the JWT token in the request headers.

### 2. Authorizer Middleware

The `authorizer` middleware function is used to authorize requests based on user roles. It checks if the user's role is included in the specified role array.

## Installation

To install and run the MediConnect API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Jishnuraj2001/doctor_patient_appointment_booking_system_pococare.git



2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the required environment variables as mentioned in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

5. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm run server
   ```

6. The server will start running at `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the value of the `process.env.port` environment variable.

## Environment Variables

The MediConnect API requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `port`: The port number on which the server should run.
- `key`: Secret key used for JWT signing.
- `email_password`: The Secret key used to send mail to the user when an appointment is booked or cancelled.
- `db_url`: MongoDB Atlas cluster URL where you are storing the data.

You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
port=3000
key=your-secret-key
email_password=your-email-password
db_url=your-mongodb-url
```

## Dependencies

The MediConnect API relies on the following dependencies:

- express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist

 web framework for Node.js.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.
- bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.
- jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- nodemailer: Library for sending emails.
- nodemon: For running the server.
- socket.io: for real-time communication and event handling.
- peerjs: for establishing peer-to-peer connections between the doctor and patient.
- ejs: A simple and flexible templating engine that enables generating HTML markup with embedded JavaScript code.

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to the `package.json` file.





## Video Calling API Documentation

This documentation provides information about the video calling functionality in the MediConnect appointment booking system. The video calling feature allows doctors and patients to join a video call when they have the same appointment ID.

### Start Video Call

To start a video call, follow the steps below:

1. The doctor/patient can initiates the video call by clicking on the "Video Consultation" button for a specific appointment.

   This endpoint redirects the doctor to a new URL with the appointment ID as the endpoint.

   - `:appointmentId` - Replace with the actual appointment ID.

   Example:

   ```
   http://localhost:<port>/<specific appointmentId>
   ```

2. The doctor/patient will be redirected to a video consultation page where they can interact with the other person.

### Join Video Call

To join a video call as a patient/doctor, follow the steps below:

1. By clicking the above same btn the doctor/patient can join the video call.

   Example URL: `http://localhost:<port>/<specific appointmentId>`

3. The patient/doctor will be redirected to the video consultation page where they can interact with the doctor.

   This endpoint renders an EJS template for the video consultation page.

   - `:appointmentId` - Replace with the actual appointment ID.


### Video Consultation Page

The video consultation page allows doctors and patients to interact during the video call. It includes the following features:

- Video Grid: Displays the video streams of both the doctor and the patient.
- Toggle Audio: Button to mute/unmute the audio during the video call.
- Toggle Camera: Button to turn on/off the camera during the video call.

**Note:** The video consultation page uses the following JavaScript libraries:

- `socket.io` for real-time communication and event handling.
- `peerjs` for establishing peer-to-peer connections between the doctor and patient.
- `ejs` A simple and flexible templating engine that enables generating HTML markup with embedded JavaScript code.
- `script.js` contains the JavaScript code for handling audio and video toggles, connecting to the video call, and managing user streams.

### Disconnect from Video Call

To disconnect from a video call, simply close the video consultation page or navigate away from the page. The connection will be automatically terminated, and the doctor and patient will be disconnected.
